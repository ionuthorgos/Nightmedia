Playwright has its own test runner for end-to-end tests, we call it Playwright Test.

Resilient â€¢ No flaky tests
Auto-wait. Playwright waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions. It also has a rich set of introspection events. The combination of the two eliminates the need for artificial timeouts - a primary cause of flaky tests.

# Project Setup

## Pre-installation Requirements:
1. Install Node.js
2. Install Playwright (JavaScript version)

## Running the Project:
To get the project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. npm install
2. To run a specific test file with debugging enabled:
npx playwright test {yourfileName}.spec.ts --debug

In our case I suggest to use the playwright interface from where you can select a spicifc test or all:
npx playwright test  --ui  --debug

I am suggest to select "Run all button" to see that the tests are fullyParallel running
